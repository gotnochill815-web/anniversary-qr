💖 Anniversary QR — A Small Surprise Project

This isn’t a big or fancy project — and it wasn’t meant to be.

My 10-year-old cousin asked me if I could “make a QR that plays a special video” for his parents’ anniversary.
So… I built this simple little web app for him.

🎁 What it does

Shows a cute anniversary landing page

Displays a QR code that opens a hidden player.html

Plays an anniversary video he selected

Includes floating hearts animation

Works perfectly when deployed (Netlify)

🛠 Tech Used

HTML / CSS / JavaScript

Hearts animation in JS

QR generated using QRious

Hosted on Netlify

⚡ Why this exists

Because sometimes a kid wants to do something sweet for his parents — and sometimes you help him build it.
That's it. No big “startup idea”, no huge features… just a simple memory.

❤️ Special Note

If you're a parent reading this because your kid made you scan the QR…
Happy Anniversary!
You raised a thoughtful little human.
